## Testing 

This is my first project. As such, the first error I made was leave the README to the end. I must acknowledge this here and inform I realized this needed to be made side by side with the website I created.  in my time making the website I have learned a lot, and some of them so fast and in such a high quantity, they needed to be detailed immidiatly. With that said, I will do what I can to detail what was done. 

- Tested header position and found it bunched up. used float to correct.
- Added home page pictures and text to it. in test found them needed to be aligned correctly. used inline-block.
- added a placeholder footer.
- added background picture and text to the about us section. in testing found the text on top of the header. Used a div with margins to center. 
- added table and form to the contact page. used absolute position to center.
- in responsiveness testing, learned that float, absolute position and large margin setting makes it so nothing will ever be responsive. 
- restyled all of the above using flexbox, leaving only the about us margin in. 
- added media queries for the margin and some different display properties for mobile. appeared good in testing this time.
